Tab Position Customizer 2
=========================

Chrome extension to customize tab opening position and closing behavior.

Based on the Tab Position Customizer extension.  I changed the name, the icon and removed some code that was accessing Google Analytics.  I left the other language files alone.  If you speak one of those languages, send me an update.

Install
-------
Can be installed from the [Chrome Extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/)

Or you can download the code, enable developer mode on the Chrome extensions page and add it with "Load unpacked extension".

More info on this at the [Chrome extensions overview](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/overview).

Credits
-------
Based on the Tab Position Customizer extension that disappeared for some reason.

Thanks to Alessandro Rei for creating the icon.
